FCBS CARBON v0.8.4
01/02/2021
Release Notes:
- Fixed trailing decimal places on graphs
- Added in additional notes on build ups of materials
- Domestic joisted floors changed from 50x250mm to 50x200mm
- Office joisted floors changed from 50x350mm at 400mm centres to 50x300 at 300mm centres
- Added 50% GGBS mix to all concrete elements
- Beam and Block lowest floor slab build up added
- Added the "Ground Insulation" category, with EPS, XPS, and Mineral Wool
- EPS, Cellulose, Sheeps Wool, and Vacuum Panels added to the wall and roof insulation list
- XPS embodied carbon value updated. 
- Foamglass added under capping beams for small buildings, which will work without adding piles to the building
- Greenroof added for roof finish
- Bitumen membrance added for roof finish
- Ceramic roof tiles added for roof finish
- Timber cassette added as roof construction
- Reordered facade materials to highlight structure
- Expansion of facade build ups, including more combinations of structure and rain screens.
- Addition of render materials (note lime and cementiuous renders have been added for Timber Cassette panels, but not elsewhere as the difference for embodied carbon is minimal).
- Addition of description for services. Note, these are pretty indicative at best as no robust figures really exist yet and they could be much higher!
- Added a "Notes" column to capture any assumptions on Input 2 - Embodied Carbon
- Added party walls as subset of facades. Note, we may split this out in future but would like to hear your thoughts
- Carbon sequestration: currently we assume the timber won't be burnt at end of life, which is not inline with BS EN 15978, but does seem more sensible. We're working on a significant change to how the calculations include this change.
