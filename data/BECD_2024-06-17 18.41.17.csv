Dualling an existing single carriageway - including accompanying structures & earthworks - Low Scenario,BECD-a4d9ee60-9445-4dc3-b1d4-4d6f76e7fd4f,"This asset represents median modelled carbon estimates, based on 10 carbon assessments, for dualling an existing single carriageway (including accompanying structures and earthworks). Values are normalised per kilometre of road. Median and high estimates are available in the equivalent assets.

Individual assessments are available to capture what percentage of the road is dualled through offline dualling (meaning that the existing single carriageway is maintained to carry one direction of traffic), as opposed to constructing two new carriageways.

Individual assessments are available to capture what percentage of the road is dualled through offline dualling (meaning that the existing single carriageway is maintained to carry one direction of traffic), as opposed to constructing two new carriageways. These include A1-A3 (construction materials) and A5 (construction plant). They represent an average topography, with standard materials and construction processes.
